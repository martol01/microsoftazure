<h2>Information about myself</h2>
<p>My name is Martin Lazarov. I am nineteen years old and I am from Bulgaria. Currently, I am in my second year of studies of MEng Computer Science.
My interests outside of Computer Science are sports, films and music. My favourite sport is football. Every week I play and watch football with my friends.
From time to time I attend some music concerts and often I go to the cinema to watch some new and exciting movies.

<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>This is a project which is designed to create a device that will help people with dementia or learning disabilities
in their every day life allowing them to store information about things they like and dislike and providing a framework which will provide all of the information
to the doctors or other people interested in it.
